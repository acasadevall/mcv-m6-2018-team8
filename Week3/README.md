# Week 3

This Week's README help us to prepare the environment in order to be able to code correctly for each second delivery. We explain the use of each python file and its respective function.

## Description by Tasks

### Task 1
We have created the python file `Holefilling.py` in order to post-process the results of the best configuration in Week 2 that was the adaptive gaussian model. We have chosen the best rho value and swept the array of alphas (10 points from 0 to 5). The goal is to post-process it with hole filling and improve the results obtained in the adaptive gaussian model of the week before with each dataset.

### Task 2


### Task 3


### Task 4


## Execution usage
### Holefilling and OneSingleGaussianAdapt (Task 1.x - 2.x)

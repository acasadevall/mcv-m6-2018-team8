# Video Surveillance for Road Traffic Monitoring

## Introduction 

The goal of this project is to learn the basic concepts and techniques related to video sequences processing, mainly for surveillance applications.

The main techniques of video processing will be applied in the context of video surveillance: moving object segmentation, motion estimation and compensation and video object tracking are basic components of many video processing systems.

The performance of the developed techniques will be measured using standard metrics for video analysis.
